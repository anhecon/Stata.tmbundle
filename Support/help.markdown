Snippets for Stata Commands
---------------------------

Snippets are generally used to avoid having to type the same thing repeatedly, 
thereby increasing coding efficiency. However, they may also be used to provide 
a type of command-line menu interface for Stata commands. This is especially 
useful for commands that you may use infrequently or for which the options are 
unique to that command (and therefore difficult to remember or guess). You may 
tab through the various options, using control+delete to omit an option 
entirely.

Tab triggers for Stata commands correspond to the minimal abbreviation accepted 
by Stata for that command.
